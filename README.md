# Darma Test

This is a demo app for the Family Activity Planning Web App to enable Darma to explore its potential to enhance the lives of busy families and let them attend their childrenâ€™s sports activities.

# Setting up the project

This project has 3 parts:

  * Infrastructure created with Docker and Docker Compose.
  * Backend created with FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
  * Frontend created with React using Vite.

## Infrastructure

To run the infrastructure, you need to have `docker` and `docker compose` installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
sh install.sh
```

To stop the infrastructure, you can run the following commands:

```bash
cd docker
sh uninstall.sh
```

## Backend

To run the backend, you need to have `python` v3.x and `pip` installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

* Navigate to the `backend` directory and copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

* Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

* Activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

* Run the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

* Run the backend service to listen to the Redis key expiration events:
```bash
cd src
python scheduler.py
```

* Close the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### API Documentation

You can access the API documentation by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser, to see the available endpoints given by FastAPI.

Also, you can open Postman and import the [Darma.postman_collection.json](./Darma%20test.postman_collection.json) file to see the available endpoints and test them. There are some examples of requests and responses in the collection.

## Frontend

To run the frontend, you need to have `node` and `npm` installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

* Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

* Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

* Run the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

***note***: the frontend is far from complete and functional (sorry!).

# Admin tools

There are 2 tools in the `docker compose` infrastructure to help you manage the data in the database and the Redis.

## PGAdmin

You can access the PGAdmin tool by visiting `http://localhost:5050` in your browser. The default username is `admin@admin.com` and the default password is `admin`.

To add the database, select `add new server` and fill in the following fields:

  * Name: `darma database`
  * Host name/address: `postgres` (docker service name)
  * Port: `5432`
  * Username: `postgres`
  * Password: `postgres`

## Redis Commander

You can access the Redis Commander tool by visiting `http://localhost:8081` in your browser. When you open Redis Commander, you should see the local database.
